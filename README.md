# Hi there, I'm Son Tung! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I am an **AI Engineer** with 5 years of experience in Computer Vision and 2 years in NLP and Large Language Models, holding a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence. I specialize in solving business problems across multiple AI domains, including vision, language, and time-series, and deploying solutions to production environments. I work effectively both independently and as part of a team, with a strong passion for continuous learning.

- Deployed a Social Listening system that crawls social network data and applies LLMs to deliver insights on keyword trends, brand reputation, and customer campaign reactions. Delivered an interactive dashboard for real-time analysis and monitoring.

### AI Engineer @ Samsung Display Vietnam (Dec 2020 - Apr 2022)
- Led team of 4 engineers to develop Deep Learning solution for automated defect detection in mobile display 
manufacturing, replacing manual inspection process.
- Deployed Transfer Learning-based UNet and YOLO models for marked region detection/segmentation on edge 
devices, achieving 95% detection accuracy.
- Reduced manufacturing costs by 80% through minimizing false positive rates and eliminating manual quality control 
labor.
- Optimized models for real-time edge deployment using TensorRT and embedded systems integration.
